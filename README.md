Description of the project:

A Mobile company is not satisfied to see that many of its customers are using inherited plans. 
They want to develop a model that can analyze customer's behavior and recommend one of its new plans: 
Smart or Ultra.
Basic machine learning algorithms will be used to create a recommending system.


The project is done in VS code with Jupyter Notebook extension.
